# Matrix

When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability
to write Ruby code the way he wanted, to remake RSpecs and business requirements
as he saw fit.  It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the
secret SOA design skills; control Git and you control the future.
 
The Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his return. That is why there are
those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for
him.
 
Do you want to know what the Matrix is, Neo?

Q:
```
Hello Iryna,

It is quite tricky challenge. I don't completely understand the aim of that. 

Does it mean that I reach the goal If I get the message 

{:"(•̀_•́ )"=>"Targeting... almost there. Lock! I got him!", :"(⌐■_■)"=>"Now, Tank
now!", :"--------"=>"--------", :"ヽ(´‿｀)ノ"=>"Welcome to the real world,
Neo."}
```

Hi Roman,

yes, you reached the goal. Key factor to success is the HTTP status code. 

Please send us your repo.
